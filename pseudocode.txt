1. Searching a simple tree of nodes where each Node has an array of child nodes (some_node.children) using DFS.

  Add root to the stack.
  Pop off, and reocrd depth from root
  Return if desired relut
  Push children onto stack in order of worst to best children


2. Searching the same tree using BFS.
  
  Enqueue initial node to queue
  Dequeue every element in queue and return if you get desired element
  Enqueue all the children

Searching a graph (represented however you feel most comfortable -- Edge List, Adjacency List or Adjacency Matrix) using DFS.
Searching the same graph using BFS.
